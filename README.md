# üìä Task 2: Data Visualization and Storytelling - Superstore Profit Leaks

## Project Overview

This project fulfills Task 2 of the Elevate Data Analyst Internship, focusing on leveraging data visualization to convey a compelling, actionable business story. Using the Superstore Sales data, the objective was to diagnose areas of low profitability and provide clear recommendations.

**Tool Used:** Microsoft Power BI Desktop

## üí° The Story: Diagnosing the Central Region Crisis

The dashboard tells a structured story, guiding stakeholders from the overall problem to specific actions:

1.  **The Problem:** The overall company **Profit Margin is only 12.0%** (as shown by the KPI cards). Regional analysis revealed the **Central Region** is the clear underperformer, dragging down overall profitability.
2.  **The Diagnosis (Root Cause):** When isolating the Central Region, the primary loss drivers were identified as **Tables, Furnishings, and Appliances**.
3.  **The Proof (Actionable Insight):** The Sales vs. Profit Scatter Plot confirms that the Central Region is selling a high volume (**large bubbles**) of products that are generating little to **negative profit** (dots close to or below the X-axis). This strongly indicates an urgent need to review **pricing or supply chain costs**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Dashboard Components

| Visual | Business Question Answered |
| :--- | :--- |
| **KPI Cards** | What is the current scale of Sales, Profit, and overall Margin? |
| **Regional Profit Margin** | Where are the biggest profit leaks located geographically? |
| **Product Losses Bar Chart** | What specific products are causing the losses in the problem region? |
| **Sales vs. Profit Scatter** | Is the problem a result of poor pricing/cost structure on high-volume items? |

## üöÄ Recommendation

**PRIORITY ACTION: Initiate an immediate review of pricing and logistics costs for 'Tables' and 'Furnishings' within the Central Region to stabilize the region's profitability.**
